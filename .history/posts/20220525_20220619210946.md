<p>1. My First Post</p>

<p>Welcome to my blog. 
Today is my first day in setting up the personal blog and writing my first blog post.
I have been practising in nursing for a few years and started studying coding recently.
It is a brand new subject for me but I enjoy doing it a lot.
<br/>
The first reason for setting up this blog is to practice on coding.
As I have just learnt NextJS, I would really like to put it into real project and show it to everyone.<br/>
Also, I would like to keep a journal for my learning progress. <br/>
It would be great if I can record the obstacles and solutions along my learning journey.<br/>
<br/><br/>
Although most of the layout havent been created yet. I am looking forward to set them up.<br/>
In the meantime, I will also keep updating my github and twitter account.
<br/><br/>
Time to start this amazing journey.
