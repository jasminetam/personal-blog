<p>9. New Project 1</p>

<br/>
<p> Today, I started a new project that is making an web app about managing expenses.<br/>
By using the useState and useEffect methods, an input object is created for adding the user input to the local storage of the web.<br/>
Also, an clear function is also added if too much items has been added, the local storage can be clear by user.<br/>
But making sure they won't accidently click on the clear button, a warning message has also been set up to avoid this.<br/>
More modification would be added tomorrow.
