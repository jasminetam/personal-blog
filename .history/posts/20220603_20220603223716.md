<p>10. New Project 1 - 2</p>

<br/>
<p> I have rebuild the whole project today as I have found a method to make the whole project more organized and easy to maintain.<br/>
I learnt about using custom hooks to store local storage values and make it work like the useState. Also, I learnt to us useContext for my project. 
It helped to store all the global states and functions of the project. By wrapping it outside the App component, I dont have to brought forward every paramaters to different components. It is really useful.<br/>
Moreover, I had also use useRef for my project. It helped accessing the DOM elements from the user input, so that I can store them to the local storage.<br/>
Tomorrow, I will continue to add new feature to the project.
