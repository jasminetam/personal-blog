<p>11. New Project 1 - 3</p>


<p> I have been modifying the design of the budget app today.<br/>
When doing research on writing my own css code. I have studied more about the difference in using Bootstrap, original css and tailwindcss.<br/>
Bootstrap is a very convenient tool for developers as it provide all the pre-set styling. If we would like to create a project for studying on a new language, it would save us time in customizing the layout by ourselves. However, it's styling is standardized and not much changes is allowed when implementing them.<br/>
Tailwind CSS is a great tool to use for typing CSS. They can be type into the html files as a class with short-forms. If users are familiarized with the tool, it can save us time in typing CSS in another file with separated class names. However, it needs time to get familiarized and more steps in setting up the environment, so that the system can watch on the files for compiling the css files.<br/>
Therefore, I choose to type my own css files at the moment as it allows me to get customize my preferred styles and practise on all ranges of css tags.<br/>
