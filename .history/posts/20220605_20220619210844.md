<p>12. New Project 2 - 1</p>


<p> I am interested about using typescript to build a website. Therefore, I have decided to use typescript to build this project as to practice on this framework.<br />
Javascript is a dynamically typed language which means that the types are checked, and datatype errors are spotted only at the runtime. It gives us flexibility but more potential errors can be made. <br/>
For Typescript, it is a static typing framework. It defines every variables in the code and make sure we stick with how has been defined afterwards. It is less error-prone by early spotting of bugs and got better performance when executing. It helps to maintain a large-sized codebase with a large amount of team members working on the same project.<br/>
Learning typescript could help us in getting used to a more strict environment in coding and easier to fit in our job even they are not using the typescript as we could consider more about the type of the variables.<br/>
It has been a exciting experience in working on a different programming language. Time flies when learning and coding.
