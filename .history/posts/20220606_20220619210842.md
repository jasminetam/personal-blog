<p>13. New Project 2 - 2</p>


<p> After a long day of work. I got only a few hours to work on my project today.<br />
I have been searching which framework I should be using for doing the login page for my shopping cart website. As the shopping cart website is just a single page app at the moment, I am trying build more pages and use the react router to manage them.<br/>
For the login page, I will use node.js with axios and redux.<br/>
Unfortunately, I could only managed to do some css on my icons and layout with limited time.<br/>
Hopefully, I can start work on the login functions tomorrow.
