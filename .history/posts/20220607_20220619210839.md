<p> An application programming interface (API) helps a company to open up their application's data and functionality to external third party developers. It allows developer to build a web application based on the API without knowing how it is implemented. <br/>
How API works? An client application can initiates an API call to request data via API's uniform resource identifier (URI). The server will send a responese  to the API after a valid request has been made. Finally, the API can transfer the data to to the initial application.<br />
What are the advantages of using API? API can improve collaboration, it can automate workflows and improve workplace collation. Also, it offers more flexibility for companies to partnered with other biggest enterprises.<br/>
