<p>15. topic study 1 - 2 </p>


<p> Yesterday, I have mentioned about the general idea about API.<br />
Today, I have studied more about REST APIs. It is defined as the application programming interface that conforms to the restraints of REST architectural style and allows for the interaction with RESTful web services.<br />
REST is a set of architectural constraints. When a client request is made via RESTful API, it will be delivered in one of the serveral formats via HTTP, for example, JSON, HTML, Python etc.<br/>
JSON is the most common file format to use for RESTful API as it is more readable by both human and machine.
What is considered to be RESTful, including the followings:<br/>
It is made up of clients, servers and resources with requests managed through HTTP.<br/>
It is a stateless client-server communication which no client information is stored.<br/>
Cacheable date is included.<br/>
It is a uniform interface which information can be transferred in a standard form.<br/>
A layered system that organizes each type of server involved th retrieval of requested information.<br/>
Although it demands some many criteria to conform to, it is still easier to use compared to the Simple Object Access Protocal as it is faster and lighter.
