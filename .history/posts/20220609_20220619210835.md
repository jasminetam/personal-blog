<p>16. New project 2 -3 </p>


<p> Setting up the backend is a brand new area for me.<br />
First of all, I have to make sure I get the environment prepared. I have choose to deploy my app on vercal through github. Then I install MongoDB and postman for managing and testing the database. I am a little bit stuck with the validation of the user input now. Hopefully, I can get it sorted tomorrow and could finish up with the login system quickly.
