<p>17. New project 2 - 4 </p>

<p> It has been a long day on work. I managed to work on the login system in the evening. I have connected the front end and the back end by using heroku with MongoDB. Everything was tested alright on postman after fixing some typos. However, when using axios to do the post request. The signup function was not working. I fixed some typos but still could not by able to send the user information to the database. I will try to work on this tomorrow.
