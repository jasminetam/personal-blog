<p>18. Shopping cart project 3</p>

<br/>
<p> I have successfully solved the problem I had yesterday. The signup function was not working because of the typescript error and some typos.<br/>
Then, I decided to deploy some of my projects and post them to my blog.
But I faced a lot of difficulties during the deployment of the Spotifake.
The frontend and backend could not be connected properly. At last, I did figure out the problem was on the settings on heroku and successfully depolyed my project.<br/>
I am planning to go back to redevelop my bolg and make it better in the coming few days.
