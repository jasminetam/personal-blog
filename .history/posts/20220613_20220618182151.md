<p>20. Learning GraphQL</p>

<br/>
<p> Last time, I have studied about Rest API and had built a spotigy clone - spotifake by calling the spotify API. The use of API is a very common on current websites. It would be great if I could have a better knowledge to use them to build my own projects as it would make the page easier to build and more features can be collaborated. The coming project is to use GraphQL to build a website.
