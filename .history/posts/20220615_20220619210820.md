<p>22. A new project</p>


<p> GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.<br/>
By Using GraphQL for the project management project, I learnt how to make use of this framework to set functionality in the backend and link them to the frontend by using Apollo Server.
