<p>29. Testing</p>

<p> 
Today, I would like to share more on testing. I have started using Jest and Enzyme to do simple tests on my blog. These two are one of the most popular tools in doing testing web development. Although they are different but they are complimentary tools, that can integrate well together to provide flexible and creative testing abilities. Jest is a JavaScript unit testing framework, used by Facebook to test services and React applications. It provides Snapshot testing, thatability to create a rendered ‘snapshot’ of a component and compare it to a previously saved ‘snapshot’. The test will fail if the two do not match.
