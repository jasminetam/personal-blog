<p>30. Testing</p>

<p> 
For IT development team to work on a project, we will need to 
Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so, you avoid integration challenges that can happen when waiting for release day to merge changes into the release branch.

Continuous integration puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch.

I have tried set up the jest config and have written some tests to test the components on my blog.
