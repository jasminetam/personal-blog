<p>30. Testing</p>

<p> 
For IT development team to work on a project, we will need to implement development practices and DevOps called CI/CD (Continue Integration vs Continue Delivery vs Continue Depolyment)
</p>
<br />
<p>
Developers working in a team which practicing continuous integration(CI) would merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so, integration challenges that can happen when waiting for release day to merge changes into the release branch can be greatly avoided.
</p>
<p>
For CD, it can be either continuous delivery or continue is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. 

This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button.

I have tried set up the jest config and have written some tests to test the components on my blog.
