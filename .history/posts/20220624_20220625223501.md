<p>31. Testing</p>

<p> 
When a team of developers are working on a project, a software platform that called Docker would be applied. Docker allows them to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. It packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. By using Docker, applications can be quickly deployed and scaled into any environment and making sure the code will run.
</p>
<p>Docker is an operating system for containers which works similarl to how a virtual machine virtualizes (removes the need to directly manage) server hardware, containers virtualize the operating system of a server. Docker is installed on each server and provides simple commands you can use to build, start, or stop containers.
