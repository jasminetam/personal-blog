<p>Docker is an operating system for containers which works similar to a virtual machine that virtualizes the server hardware. Containers virtualize the operating system of a server. Docker is installed on each server and provides simple commands which can be used to build, start, or stop containers. This helps the company to ship more software faster especially for microservices. It also standardize the operations who can be easier to deploy. Many cloud computing services such as AWS support the use of docker and makes it even more attractive to use.
