<p>2. Blog development 1</p>
<br/>
<p>Although I have already started develop the layout of my personal blog using react, I would like to use Nextjs to make it as a Static site generator.
<br/>
After I have finished some of the code by using the Nextjs, I tried to merge my layout to the current site. I have encountered some errors but I felt a sense of achievement after solving these problems.
<br/>
I believe the most effective way of learning web development is to make mistakes, realize mistakes, find the solution and make it as the experiences.
<br/>
I find coding chanllenging and exciting. Thus, this is why I love coding.
