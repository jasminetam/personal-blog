<p>5. Blog development 3</p>

<br/>
<p>Further modification on the layout this morning. <br/>
Then, I have been learning React Hooks to manipulate the state.<br/>
I managed to create the Search Bar for filtering posts by titles.<br/>
Moreover, I have used useState and useEffect to categorize the posts<br/>
<br/>
I have also designed my favicon to show on the title.<br/>
I love the fonts from google very much. Cormorant SC is one of my favourite font at the moment.<br/>
Tonight I will start on a new project and I start getting excited now.
