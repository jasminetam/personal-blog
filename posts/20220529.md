<p>5. Blog development 3</p>
<p>I have changed changed the layout of the homepage today.
Removed some of the features, so to make it more simple and easy to view.
<br>
Finally, I have rendered my blog posts with layout but still working on how to make it more eye-catching.
Some errors have been fixed as well. 
<br>
Later in the day, I have also changed the style of the buttons and add a contact page.
