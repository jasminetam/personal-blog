<p>6. More Tutorials on Nextjs and React</p>

<br/>
<p>I have made a simple todoList in a single page by using Nextjs. <br/>
I have also be able to make a Spotify clone after watching a tutorial.<br/>
<br/>
It uses a spotify api and could play songs as what spotify does.<br/>
A serach function is added for searching a track by typing the name of the track or the artist of the track. After that, when they click on the selected track, an autoplay function is added.
<br/>
According to the tutorial, lyrics function has also been added to this new app.<br/>
A server has also been set up for doing the login on spotify.<br/>
I have learnt some basic concept on using express, axios and also the cors and body parser. The app can be able to check the token, refresh the token and when it expires, a error will be returned. <br/>
It was fun in learning with the is api. I am glad that I could make something that is really enjoyable.
