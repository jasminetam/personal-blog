<p>6. Tutorials on testing</p>

<br/>
<p>I have studied some materail about Jest, the testing framework. <br/>
It is a fast and safe framework to run on our code. It can ensure the test have unique global state and the coverage of the test can be shown. <br/>
<br/>
Jest works on testing functions on our code. After inserting values and mocking the functions. It can also be used to compare our code with the screenshot of the original code before we merge any branches to the master repository.<br/>
I would like to study more about Jest and start to write some test code on my projects soon.
