<p>7. Improveng performance part 1</p>

<br/>
<p> Ther are ways to imporve performace of our websites.<br />
First, we could minimize the text of the project. There are tools, for example, UgligfyJS for minimizing the javascript by minimise the whitespace.
By doing this, machine can still read the code but the file size can be minimised.<br/>
Second, minimising images is also helpful on improving performance.<br/>
In different situations, we could use fifferent image file types. For example, if we want some animations, Gif would be a good choice. <br/>
We should always resize the image to the size that we would like to display to make sure no unnecessary pixels are added to the page. There are tools such as TingPNG for reducing PNG and JPEG-optimizer for reducing JPG sizes.
On the otherhand, metadata from images could also be removed to minimise the size of the images. <br/>
There are still more ways to improving the performance in different aspects.
I wil talk about them next time.
