<p>39. Heroku</p>

<p> After we have finished the initial development of our application, we need to find a hosting site for deployment and make it the production version. One of the popular one is called heroku. It is a cloud platform as a service support serveral programming languages such as Java, Node.js, Ruby and PHP etc.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Let me walk you through the deployment process. First you need to create a Heroku account and it is free for the first 550 dyno hours. Then, you have to make sure you make it as a git repository. Next, you may link the repository from Github to Heroku. After that, make sure you have to configure Heroku according to your setting for the application. Remember to configure the environment variables on Heroku. Finally, your work can be hosted and view by everyone who has access to your link.
