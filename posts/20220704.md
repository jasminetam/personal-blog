<p>41. SQL and NoSQL</p>

<p>A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. The most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data. On the contrast, a NoSQL, or nonrelational database, allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated. It grew popular as web applications became more common and more complex. It stored as JSON documents and can be flexibly use according to the purpose. These two types of databases got its pros and cons. It is great if we can learn bothof them and depends on the types of data that require for the project to choose which to use.
