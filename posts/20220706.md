<p>43. Headless CMS</p>

<p>Yesterday, we have talked about Headless CMS. Among them, Strapi is one of the leading open-source headless CMS. It is interesting to use as it is flexible and allows a lot of customization, other than just built in function and plugins. It supports many databases such as MongoDB, MySQL and Postgres. It can consume a API from clients or mobile apps by using REST API or GraphQL. It also got a built in JWT authentications and permissions by assigning roles to different users, emailing system, sorting and filtering functionality. On it's website, a community of strapi developers could exchange ideas to solve complex problems.
<br />
However, it still got some constraints while using to build an web application. As the documentation is only for brief usage of strapi, for more complex usage which requires more modification on the backend server, the support is limited. As it is currently upgraded from v3 to v4, even it improves performance on a lot of areas, some functions that works on v3, are not working on v4 now. When doing the migration on current stage, it takes longer time to find a possible solutions. 
<br/>
I believe Strapi is a great headless CMS, if it keeps updating and more people start using it, the above problems can eventually resolved.
