<p>47. Tailwind CSS </p>

<p> Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to enable users to create applications faster and easier. We can use utility classes without leaving your main code and edit them just within the className. What is the benefit in using tailwind CSS? The CSS file can be smaller as the styles can be reusable. Also, we dont have to keep inventing new classNames for editing the style, just simply write it according to the design system or within the className tags. Unlike CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Material UI, it is more flexible as the components are not fully styled and the user interface can be more unique with customization. However, tailwind is one of the hardest tools to pick up as it uses different shorthands and requires an understanding of different layers of Tailwind, a strong understanding on CSS is also needed. On the other hand, as all the styling are put in the className, it would be very long, take up the spaces for the main jsx code and violate the principle of separation.

I am new to Tailwind CSS and still learning. I believe it is a great tool for increasing the web development speed and it is a attractive skill sets for frontend development. We should take sometimes to equip it, after investing time on it, we will be benefied from it.
