<p>56. OOP Basics Part 3</p>

<p> For Polymorphism, it is further devided into 4 types.
Ad-hoc Polymorphism allows functions having same name to act differently for different types which also known as Overloading.
<br>
Inclusion Polymorphism is the ability to use derived classes through base class pointers and references.** It is also known as Run-time polymorphism because the address of the function is not located by the Compiler at compile-time, rather, the right pointer from the virtual table is dereferenced to invoke the function at run-time. It is also known as Subtyping.
<br>
Coercion Polymorphism, which also known as Casting, occurs when an object or primitive is cast into some other type.** It could be either Implicit or Explicit.
<br>
Parametric Polymorphism opens a way to use the same piece of code for different types.** It is implemented by the use of Templates. It is also known as Early Binding.
