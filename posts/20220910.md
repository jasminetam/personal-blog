<p>60. Reaching out for jobs</p>

<p> When it comes to reaching out for jobs and completing interview tasks, I believe that preparation and perseverance are keys. 
<br />
I try to stay organized by keeping track of my job applications and following up with potential employers after submitting my resume. 
<br />
Additionally, I make sure to research the company and familiarize myself with the job requirements before I submit my application or complete any interview tasks. 
<br />
When I receive a task to complete, such as a coding challenge or a case study, I give myself enough time to work on it, and I make sure to read the instructions carefully. If I get stuck, I don't hesitate to reach out to the employer for clarification. 
<br />
Overall, I try to approach the job search process with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn from each experience, whether it results in a job offer or not.
