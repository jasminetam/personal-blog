<p>61. Start my new job</p>

<p> I'm so excited to have landed my first permanent job in software engineering! My first day on the job was a mix of emotions - I felt both thrilled and nervous. As this is a remote position, I feel like a bit confused. But my colleagues were all so welcoming and friendly, and it felt great to be part of a team that was passionate about technology and innovation. It was an unforgettable day, and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to begin my career in software engineering.
