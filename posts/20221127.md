<p>62. One month review</p>

<p> Adjusting to a new job can be challenging, but I was excited to take on this new opportunity. As I settle into my new role, I'm realizing that I'll have to spend less time on my personal projects, such as writing blog posts. However, I've also recognized the importance of continuing to learn and grow in my field. To achieve this, I'm committed to spending more time taking courses on LinkedIn Learning and other online resources. Although it may require some extra effort and time management, I believe that investing in my professional development is crucial for my long-term success and job satisfaction. While I'll miss some of my previous creative pursuits, I'm excited to take on new challenges and broaden my skill set.
