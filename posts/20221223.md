<p>63. Met my friend and Christmas is coming</p>

<p> I recently met up with a friend who was visiting from another part of England, and we had an amazing time exploring London together. We decided to go to Winter Wonderland, which was bustling with people and festive activities. We indulged in some delicious street food and hot chocolate while taking in the atmosphere and admiring the beautiful Christmas lights. Afterward, we found a cozy spot in a nearby caf√© and caught up over some more food and drinks. It was great to chat about our plans for the upcoming Christmas holiday and reminisce about old times. Spending time with my friend made me realize how much I miss having these types of experiences and connections with people, and I'm already looking forward to our next get-together.
