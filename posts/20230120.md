<p>64. Start my new job</p>

<p> I'm grateful to have passed my probations and would like to reflect on my work so far. Although it has just  been a short time since I joined the company, I've learned a great deal and grown both personally and professionally. I'm lucky to be part of such a supportive team that has helped me to adapt quickly to my new role and provided valuable guidance and feedback along the way. I know there's still so much to learn and improve upon, and I'm eager to continue to challenge myself and contribute to the team's success. While I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far, I also recognize that there's always room for improvement, and remain committed to taking on new challenges and expanding my skill set. Hopefully I could contribute to the company and grow on my own career.
