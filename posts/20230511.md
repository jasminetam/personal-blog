<p>70. Summary on popular javascript frameworks in 2023</p>

<p>
In 2023, several JavaScript frameworks continue to dominate the frontend development landscape, each with its own strengths and use cases. 
<br />
React remains one of the most widely adopted frameworks, known for its component-based architecture and virtual DOM. It offers excellent performance and community support, making it suitable for complex applications.
<br />
Next.js is a popular framework built on top of React, designed specifically for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). It provides a powerful routing system, automatic code splitting, and built-in API routes, making it an excellent choice for building dynamic and high-performance web applications. Next.js also offers features like pre-rendering, serverless functions, and a rich plugin ecosystem, making it versatile for various project sizes and types.
<br />
Angular is a comprehensive framework maintained by Google. It provides a complete solution for building large-scale applications with features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a robust CLI. Angular is best suited for enterprise-level projects.
<br />
Vue.js has gained significant popularity due to its simplicity and gentle learning curve. It offers great flexibility, making it easy to integrate with existing projects. Vue.js focuses on the view layer, but still provides essential features like reactivity and component-based architecture.
<br />
Svelte takes a different approach by compiling components into highly efficient JavaScript code during build time. This results in smaller bundle sizes and improved runtime performance. Svelte is ideal for creating lightweight applications and has gained attention for its simplicity and ease of use.
<br />
Ember.js is a full-featured framework that prioritizes convention over configuration. It offers a robust set of tools, including an ORM, routing, and testing support. Ember.js is a good choice for large-scale applications with complex requirements.
<br />
Each framework has its own ecosystem, documentation, and community support, so it's essential to consider factors such as project requirements, team expertise, and scalability when choosing a framework. Ultimately, the best framework depends on the specific needs of the project and the preferences of the development team.
